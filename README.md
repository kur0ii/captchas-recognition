## About

This project aims to develop an automated solution utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict text-based captchas.

The dataset link is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images/data).


## Installation

Make sure you have installed all the necessary libraries before executing the code, with the command below :
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Structure 

The project is organized into several files, each with a specific role:

- **/dataset :** Directory for Captchas images.

- **/checkpoint_model :** Directory for saving the trained model.

- **captchas_recognition.ipynb :**
  - Loads data, pre-processes it, divides it into training and test sets.
  - Creates, trains and evaluates the customized model.
  - Displays classification reports, confusion matrices and demo.

- **requirements.txt :** 

- **README.md :**
